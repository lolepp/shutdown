# Shutdown script

Python script and a batch script that make your Windows computer shut down very shortly after a few seconds with a funny message appearing.

To run the Python script, you need to have the Python compiler installed.

The batch script does not work correctly in the current version unfortunately. :(

These script are written to work on Windows. So they will not work on any other operating system.
